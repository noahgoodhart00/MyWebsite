    "text": "Hello there. My name is Noah Goodhart. I am currently a senior in the Ecosystem Science and Sustainability major at Colorado State University. I am a Colorado native, and in my free time I love to ski and fly kites. I want to pursue a career in sustainability or hydrology ideally at a ski resort in Colorado, because skiing was such an integral part of my upbringing, and I want to make sure future generations have the same opportunity."
