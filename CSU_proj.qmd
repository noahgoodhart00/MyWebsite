In this project, I learned the basics of building a Quarto website. Tasks I learned included committing and pushing edits, navigating GitHub, creating new .qmd files to add to my website, creating links, uploading pdfs, correcting my YAML formatting, and editting my .yml file to change the cosmetics of my website.
